THOUGHT_COMPLETION_PROMPT = """You are a helpful computer use agent designed to complete tasks on a computer. Your goal is to recreate your thought process behind a specific action.

You will be provided with:

1. The task you are attempting to complete.
2. A history of the steps you have already performed (up to 50, if any; none if it was the first action).
3. The specific action you chose to take.
4. The name of the element you clicked (if you clicked on an element). It might be too general or vague, you have to decied what to click based on the screenshot.
5. A screenshot of the computer screen at the moment you decided to take the action.
6. The red marks on the screenshot indicate the position of the click or drag action.


To formulate your thought process, consider:

1. What do you observe on the screen? Consider your task and previous action when you analyzing current screenshot.
2. Evaluate your previous action (if applicable):
   - Did it achieve the intended effect? If not, identify possible reasons (e.g., misclick, inactive element).
      Some typical examples for ineffective action:
       - misclick in an empty space
       - ineffective opening some elements without double click
       - ineffective type text/ press key because of inactivated input box
   - Did the result align with your previous plan, or did something unexpected happen?
      Some typical examples for ineffective action:
         - misclick in a wrong element
         - forget to clear existing text in input bar
3. Based on your action history, assess your progress toward completing the overall task.
4. Consider if you're exploring how to finish the task because of failed attempts in history steps.


Present your thought process as a clear, natural first-person narrative that explains your reasoning at that moment.

Important requirements:
1. **DO NOT** mention the red marks in your response. These marks were **added after the fact** to indicate the position of your click or drag actions, and they were not on the screen when you made the decision. **DO NOT** mention "red box", "red square", "red circle", or "red arrow" in your response.
2. Write as if you are thinking in real-time before taking the action. Do not include post-action evaluation or hindsight.
